### Timeline

Start Date: 01/09/20

Finish Date: 01/20/20

Hours Spent: 15

### Resources Used

Example Bounce code from lab
Oracle documentation on shapes, text, and rectangles

### Running the Program

Main class: InitialScreen.java

Data files needed: 

Key/Mouse inputs: W/A/S/D for one player, arrows for the other, B to begin, space to launch the ball

Cheat keys: V to speed the ball up, O to damage all of player 1's blocks, P to damage all of player 2's blocks

Known Bugs: Sometimes the collisions with the sides of the blocks when the ball is moving quickly either don't work 
    properly out or don't register in the first place. Two players cannot hold down the buttons and have both sets 
    respond properly

Extra credit: Two player game
